Mash
====

Mash, 2D Game Engine with [Ash](http://www.ashframework.org/) Entity System Framework


====
Planned features:

**Editor**

Editor Ã  la Unity Editor, but much simpler. Entity Component System approach should make this pretty straightforward.

Tech for this editor
Node-Webkit, with javascript compiled from Haxe. Allows me to benefit from anything a modern browser can do for GUI.

**Scripting**

Logic of games written in Haxe.

**Engine**

Built upon [Kha](https://github.com/KTXSoftware/Kha), to allow for targeting everything from html5 to your toaster. Also, no pesky flash imitation.

====
Expectation: This project will need some time.
