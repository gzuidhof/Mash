Mash

Mash, 2D Game Engine with Ash Entity System Framework


====
Planned features:

**Editor**

Editor Ã  la Unity Editor, but much simpler. Entity Component System approach should make this pretty straightforward.

Tech for this editor
Node-Webkit, with javascript compiled from Haxe. Allows me to benefit from anything a modern browser can do for GUI.

**Scripting**

Logic of games written in Haxe.



====
Expectation: A lot of work to be done.
